# TRONIX v0.1 — experimental native agent runtime

**Status:** native Celix scheduler and demo adapter built and smoke-tested on the
isolated Butcher development host. A restricted CDP observation adapter has also
been exercised against a dedicated isolated Chrome fixture; it is not deployed
as a production gateway. Not installed as a system daemon or production-ready.

TRONIX borrows specific _scheduling ideas_ from TRON / μITRON, not implementation
code, TRON branding rights, or hard-real-time guarantees. It currently consists of:

- `tronixd`: C++17 process hosting a real Apache Celix framework.
- `tronix_scheduler.zip`: native C Celix scheduler **service bundle**.
- `tronix_demo.zip`: separately packaged, registered Celix operation **service bundle**.
- v1 MessagePack over length-prefixed private AF_UNIX sockets. Chrome CDP remains JSON.
- One event-driven dispatch worker (generation-guarded condition variable,
  no 1ms idle polling); two trusted lanes, up to 4 interactive operations
  before background progress, per-agent fair-share selection.
- Monotonic queue-wait deadlines, including expiry accounting while another operation
  is active; fixed-capacity admission (128 global pending, 32 per agent), one active
  operation, strict request shapes, request-ID collision rejection, result lookup
  and explicit acknowledgment. The Unix listener backlog is 128 connections.
- Trusted adapter-defined execution budgets. On completion, the runtime accounts
  for elapsed execution and flags over-budget work as `overrun` (without returning
  its value). This is **non-preemptive**: already-performed side effects are not
  canceled, and a hung bundle can still block the worker.
- The synthetic adapter supports `demo.constant` -> 42, `demo.pause` -> 1 after
  15ms, `demo.slow` -> 1 after 150ms, and `demo.overrun` -> a 150ms
  operation with a trusted 20ms execution budget for regression testing.
- An optional reviewed Celix CDP bundle supports only `browser.constant` -> 42
  through the existing isolated WindAnvil browser fixture. **No raw CDP or arbitrary
  shell commands are reachable from this interface.**

## Reproduce the build

Prerequisites: Linux, CMake >=3.20, Ninja, C/C++ compilers, the required Celix
build dependencies (Jansson, libzip, etc.), Node 22, npm. The tested Celix and
MessagePack source revisions were:

- Apache Celix `270c784d20dabd0b1f6418c7ee2195822ec9ef90`
- msgpack-c `e1b8bc889d0c16714fc9236af4b954cbfa182be4`
- @msgpack/msgpack v3.1.3 for the optional Node client/tests.

On Butcher (existing pinned dependencies under the WindAnvil worktree):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/commander/windanvil-msgpack-work/.deps/local \
  -DCELIX_SOURCE=/home/commander/windanvil-msgpack-work/.deps/apache-celix \
  -DMSGPACK_SOURCE=/home/commander/windanvil-msgpack-work/.deps/msgpack-c
cmake --build build --target tronixd tronix_scheduler_bundle tronix_demo_bundle -j 3
npm ci --offline --ignore-scripts
npm test
```

On another machine, supply your own pinned source checkouts and library
dependencies. There is no provisioning script for those dependencies yet.

Run the daemon only against a private disposable directory:

```sh
mkdir -p ./private && chmod 700 ./private
./build/tronixd --socket "$(pwd)/private/tronix.sock" \
  --scheduler "$(pwd)/build/tronix_scheduler.zip" \
  --adapter "$(pwd)/build/tronix_demo.zip"
```

`TRONIX_READY` is emitted after Celix services are registered and the local
socket is listening. The socket is chmod 0600, must not already exist, and is
removed on orderly shutdown. **Do not expose the daemon as a public service.**

## Protocol v1

A request is a strict MessagePack map. Every frame is:

```text
uint32 big-endian length (1..4096) | MessagePack map
```

Each connection carries exactly one request and one response. The request
must contain exactly the documented keys, with no caller-provided `lane`,
`command`, `url` or JavaScript.

```js
{v:1,action:"submit",id:"job-1",agent:"fixture-a",
 operation:"demo.constant",deadlineMs:1000}
// -> {v:1,ok:true,id:"job-1",state:"queued"}

{v:1,action:"result",id:"job-1"}
// -> {v:1,ok:true,id:"job-1",state:"completed",dispatchSequence:1,value:42}

{v:1,action:"ack",id:"job-1"}
// -> {v:1,ok:true,state:"acked"}
```

Other actions: `ping`, `capabilities`, `snapshot`.
Results include `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `expired`, or `overrun`.
Terminal results consume one of 256 bounded slots until acknowledged. Duplicate
IDs are rejected while retained. Deadlines apply **only until dispatch**, not
to in-progress work. Expiry is recorded when the scheduler is next accessed,
including through `result` or `snapshot` while a job is running; it is not
an independent real-time timer. The v1 MessagePack wire format is unchanged;
results now also expose `budgetMs`, `queueWaitNs`, and `executionNs` for known
jobs. `snapshot` adds `overrun` and cumulative/max execution and queue-wait
nanoseconds. Celix service ABI **2.0.0** intentionally rejects old adapter bundles.

The optional JavaScript `TronixClient` is in `src/client.mjs`. It is an
IPC client, **not** the execution or scheduling runtime.

## Security and limitations

- Single local user and trust domain. The string `agent` is not authenticated.
  No multi-user isolation, capability leases, browser context separation, ACLs,
  or persistent credentials. Other processes with the same Unix UID may access
  its socket and read or acknowledge other work.
- Bundle code executes within the daemon's process. A hostile bundle is not
  sandboxed. Only load reviewed bundles.
- No crash-safe queue, WAL, durable receipts, replay, or OS scheduler priority.
  Result memory is bounded and a crashed daemon loses its work.
- Jobs are non-preemptive; queue deadlines apply to time spent waiting for
  dispatch. Execution budgets are assessed **after** the operation returns.
  This is a post-hoc fail-closed receipt, not an OS-level watchdog, cancellation,
  resource isolation, rollback, or hard real-time enforcement.
- Celix can register/unregister services, but **runtime hot-reload is not
  implemented** in this version.
- The current event loop accepts one bounded client request at a time. It is
  a lab prototype, not an optimized high-concurrency server.
- The smoke/hardening tests cover the native demo adapter, deadlines, and
  shutdown. The optional CDP integration test covers a dedicated owned Chrome
  target on Butcher; it does not establish browser isolation, multi-host
  correctness, production throughput, or real-time guarantees.

## Verification

Run `npm test` for the native smoke suite and regressions. In particular,
`tests/hardening.mjs` confirms expiry during busy execution, execution-budget
accounting and client-side override rejection, and prompt idle shutdown.
Run `npm run test:bench` to measure an optional 64-job/8-agent burst with a
synthetic 150ms blocking operation. It prints observed p50/p95 timings rather
than asserting hard real-time latency guarantees.

The opt-in browser fixture can be tested with `TRONIX_GATEWAY_MODULE` pointing
at an absolute, reviewed WindAnvil CDP gateway module and `npm run test:cdp`.
It uses a disposable dedicated Chrome target on loopback; do not point it at
an ordinary signed-in browser profile. The test writes local, unsigned
receipts under `evidence/`.

## Next engineering milestone

The next milestone is *actual* execution-time interruption/containment in a
separate process, not merely post-hoc overrun receipts. Measure wakeup jitter,
large-burst fairness, and backpressure on multiple systems. Add crash-safe
receipts, identity-bound admission, and bounded-memory provenance before any
multi-user or embedded production use.


## Thread telemetry prototype (local-only)

See [docs-thread-pilot.md](docs-thread-pilot.md) for the isolated OpenThread
POSIX simulation, native Celix adapter, and end-to-end test. Build the
optional `tronix_thread_bundle` target and run `npm run test:thread`.
It exposes read-only `thread.nodes_up` and `thread.leaders` counts over
private sockets. This is neither a LoRaWAN gateway nor a deployed radio network.
